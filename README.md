# TASK 2: Design a simple calculator with basic arithmetic operations.
Prompt the user to input two numbers and an operation choice.

Perform the calculation and display the result.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 Here's a detailed explanation of the steps involved in creating a simple calculator using Python:

1. **Function Definitions**:
    - We begin by defining four functions: `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide`. Each of these functions takes two arguments (two numbers) and returns the result of the corresponding arithmetic operation.

2. **Main Calculator Function** (`calculator`):
    - We define a main function called `calculator` to handle the user interaction and calculations.

3. **Display Options**:
    - Inside the `calculator` function, we first display the available options to the user. These options represent the four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

4. **User Input for Operation**:
    - We use the `input` function to prompt the user to enter their choice of operation. The user should type one of the operation names ('add', 'subtract', 'multiply', or 'divide').

5. **Input Validation**:
    - We check if the user's input is a valid operation by using a conditional statement (`if operation not in ('add', 'subtract', 'multiply', 'divide'):`). If the input is not valid, we display an error message and return from the function.

6. **User Input for Numbers**:
    - Next, we prompt the user to enter two numbers, one at a time, using the `input` function. We convert the input to floating-point numbers using `float()` to allow for decimal inputs.

7. **Perform Calculation**:
    - Depending on the user's chosen operation, we call the corresponding function (`add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, or `divide`) with the two input numbers. This calculates the result of the chosen operation.

8. **Display Result**:
    - Finally, we display the result of the calculation using the `print` function. The result is stored in the `result` variable, which is determined by the chosen operation.

9. **Calling the Calculator Function**:
    - After defining the `calculator` function, we call it at the end of the script to start the calculator program. This allows the user to input their choices and perform calculations.
  
  

# TASK 3: Design a password generator.
A password generator is a useful tool that generates strong and

random passwords for users. This project aims to create a
password generator application using Python, allowing users to

specify the length and complexity of the password.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



 Here's a detailed explanation of the steps involved in the provided Python script for generating random passwords:

1. **Import Required Modules:**
   - We begin by importing the necessary modules:
     - `secrets`: This module provides functions for generating cryptographically secure random numbers, which is crucial for password generation.
     - `string`: This module contains a collection of character constants like uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.

2. **Define the `generate_password` Function:**
   - We define a function called `generate_password` that takes the desired password length as its argument.
   - `characters` is a string containing all the characters from which the password will be constructed. It includes lowercase and uppercase letters, digits, and special characters.
   - Using a list comprehension, we generate a secure password by randomly selecting characters from `characters` and joining them together. This ensures a random and secure password.

3. **Define the `main` Function:**
   - The `main` function is the entry point of the script.
   - It starts by trying to get user input for the desired password length.
   - The input is converted to an integer, and a `try...except` block is used to handle potential errors if the user enters invalid input.

4. **Check the Validity of Password Length:**
   - Inside the `main` function, we first check if the entered password length is greater than zero. A password must have a positive length, so we ensure this condition is met.

5. **Generate the Password:**
   - If the entered length is valid, the `generate_password` function is called with the desired length as an argument. This generates a random password, which is then stored in the `password` variable.

6. **Display the Generated Password:**
   - Finally, the script prints the generated password on the screen using the `print` function. The user can see and use this password as needed.

7. **Error Handling for Invalid Input:**
   - If the user enters an invalid input (e.g., a non-integer or a negative number for password length), the script catches this error and informs the user that the input is invalid.

By following these steps, the script prompts the user for the desired password length, generates a secure random password of the specified length, and then displays it, ensuring the password meets the user's requirements. This script provides a basic foundation for generating passwords, and you can further enhance it to include additional features, such as complexity requirements or the ability to generate multiple passwords in one go.
